                <p>Measure your health values once a day, preferably at the same time, and answer the symptom questionnaire on your patient tablet. We recommend taking measurements immediately after getting up. In this way, the values are comparable day by day and your health condition can be evaluated in the best way.</p>
                <p>Your measurement results are securely transmitted to medical professionals and your attending physician in accordance with data protection regulations.</p>

                    <ol>
                    <li>The ECG electrode should be positioned directly against the skin.</li>
                    <li>If your skin or hands are dry, moisten them using a damp cloth before measurement.</li>
                    <li>If the ECG electrodes are dirty, remove the dirt using a soft cloth or cotton swamp dampened with disinfection alcohol.</li>
                    <li>While taking measurement, do not touch your body with the hand with which you are taking measurement.</li>
                    <li>Please note that there must be no skin to skin contact between your right and left hand. Otherwise, the measurements cannot be taken correctly.</li>
                    <li>Stay still during the measurement, do not speak and hold the device still. Movements of any kind will falsify the measurements.</li>
                    <li>If possible, take measurement when sitting and not when standing.</li>
